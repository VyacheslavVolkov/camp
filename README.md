# camp
Function that takes two arrays of integer as a parameters. Both arrays have the same size. They represent camps along a circular road in the desert (elements at index 0 represent camp 0, ... and the last index is just before the first one because the road is circular). The first array represents how much water you can get in each of the camp, the second how much water you need to go to the next camp. Let's assume that your bottle has an infinite size. The function must output at which camp you need to start, so you can do a whole loop without running out of water. Example [1,1,6], [2,2,4] => 2 (if you start at any other camp, you run out of water).
